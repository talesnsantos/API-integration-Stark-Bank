# API-integration-Stark-Bank


The Challenge
 Create a
 Project and Webhook endpoint for that account and develop a simple app integration using
whichever language you prefer that:
1. Issues 8 to 12 Invoices every 3 hours to random people for 24 hours (our Sandbox
emulation environment will make sure some of those are automatically paid);
2. Receives the webhook callback of the Invoice credit and sends the received amount
(minus eventual fees)
